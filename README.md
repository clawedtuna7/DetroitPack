Deindustrialization and its effects in the City of Detroit

Detroit, a city once synonymous with the car manufacturing industry and the great Henry Ford, is now a place most 
known for the hardhsips and trouble created as a result of a quickly declining economy in the late 20th century. 
From its success as a manufacturing-heavy economy to the declaration of bankruptcy in the year 2013, Detroit is often
seen as *the* city to have had experienced some of the worst effects of the deindustrialization period, and, as a result,
has continued to struggle in rebuilding its economy and stature in this new age.

This story is not unique, many cities, towns, and metro areas throughout the United States have experienced some 
kind of economic turbulance within recent years as the result of the decline in manufacturing based jobs/economies - 
especially in the region we now know as the Rust Belt. Enrico Moretti, author of the *"The New Geography of Jobs"*, 
mentions that the manufacturing industry - once the nation's primary economic driver - had "lost an average of 
372,000 manufacturing related jobs every year" since the mid 1980s. Many cities, like that of Chicago, learned to 
diversify and adapt their economies, while others were left struggled to so, Detroit being a primary example.

Detroit, as well as manny other cities and metropolitan areas in the Midwest, increasingly  grew in trouble 
throughout this period as factories and corporations either struggled as a resultof growing competition, introduced 
and encouraged automation, or physically moved their businesses in search of cheaper labor.

Today, the city of Detroit is different from what it was 10 years ago, and even more different from what it was 40 years ago.
The change of Detroit, economically and demographically, is what this package explores and models. Basic in its initial
data sets, this package aims to serve as the basis for a greater analysis, ~~inviting~~ ecouraging those interested to 
integrate more complex data that would help illustrate the phenomenon of desindustrialization the City of Detroit 
experienced in the time period between 1980 and 2010.
